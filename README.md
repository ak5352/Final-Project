# Final-Project

This repository holds the files for my final Drawing on the Web project

## What I hope to accomplish with this project

I want to play with the idea of creating a user experience by creating three drawings that the user can interact with. 
Since I love playing video games, I also want to make each of the drawings resemble games. To do this, I plan to make sprites out of
SVG Graphics and use the p5.play.js library to give each sprite collisions and user-controlled movement. 

## The Plan

### Drawing 1

For the first drawing, I plan to have two sprites on the page: one that is a platform and one that is a jumper, and both of which will be 
SVG graphics. At the top of the page will be some text that says, "You have jumped 0 times." If the user presses "X", the jumper jumps 
off of the platform. Upon landing, both the jumper and the platform change facial expressions and the number of times the user jumps
will increment by 1. 

### Drawing 2

I want this drawing to resemble a game I used to play with my sister as a child where we would pretend the floor was lava and thus, avoid
touching it. In this game, the user is supposed to press "X" to enable the SVG sprite to stay in the air as long as possible so as to 
avoid hitting the ground. However, if the sprite does touch the ground, the game will end and reset. 

### Drawing 3

This drawing is inspired by the Google Chrome Dinosaur game. Instead of a dinosaur jumping over cacti, however, this drawing will have
an elephant trying to jump over planks. The user presses "X" to jump over plankks, but if it collides with one, the game will end and reset.
The planks will be randomly and continuously generated as long as the elephant is alive.

### Interface

The interface will be a simple table with each row as a link to their specific drawing. If the user hovers over each link, it will
become an animated gif that underlines the text.
